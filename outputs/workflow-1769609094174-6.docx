Thank you for providing such detailed information about your SaaS product, current customer base, pricing plans, target market pain points, cost structure, regulatory considerations, and additional insights. This information will be invaluable in helping me develop a comprehensive pricing strategy for your product.

Based on the information you've provided, I've identified some key takeaways that will inform my pricing strategy development:

1. **Value-based pricing**: Your customers are willing to pay a premium for advanced features, priority support, and tailored onboarding, indicating that they perceive significant value in these offerings.
2. **Tiered pricing**: Your current pricing plans (Basic, Premium, and Enterprise) suggest a tiered pricing approach, which can help you cater to different customer segments with varying needs and willingness to pay.
3. **Customer acquisition and retention**: With a CAC of $150 and a CLV of $1,200, it's essential to focus on customer retention and upselling/cross-selling to maximize revenue and profitability.
4. **Cost structure**: Your cost structure highlights the importance of managing infrastructure, support, development, and marketing/sales expenses to maintain profitability.
5. **Regulatory compliance**: Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and industry-specific standards is crucial to maintaining customer trust and avoiding potential penalties.
6. **Flexibility and customization**: Offering flexible pricing plans, such as monthly billing and annual contracts, can help you attract and retain customers with different preferences and needs.

To further inform my pricing strategy development, I have a few questions:

1. What are your revenue growth goals for the next 6-12 months, and how do you envision your pricing strategy contributing to these goals?
2. Can you provide more information about your competitors' pricing strategies and how they differ from yours?
3. Are there any specific customer segments or industries that you're looking to target or expand into, and how might your pricing strategy need to adapt to these segments?
4. How do you currently measure customer satisfaction and feedback, and are there any plans to incorporate customer feedback into your pricing strategy development?
5. Are there any potential pricing innovations or experiments you'd like to explore, such as usage-based pricing, tiered discounts, or loyalty programs?

Once I have this additional information, I can begin developing a comprehensive pricing strategy that aligns with your business goals, customer needs, and market conditions.
