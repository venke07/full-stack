I'm excited to work with you to develop a comprehensive pricing strategy for our SaaS product. I appreciate the thorough approach you've outlined, and I'm happy to provide the additional information you've requested.

**Current Customer Base:**
Our average revenue per user (ARPU) is $50/month, with a customer acquisition cost (CAC) of $150 and a customer lifetime value (CLV) of $1,200. Our current customer base consists of small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and enterprises, with a mix of industries, including e-commerce, healthcare, and finance.

**Pricing Plans:**
We currently offer three pricing plans:

1. **Basic:** $29/month (billed annually) - includes core features, limited support, and 100 users.
2. **Premium:** $99/month (billed annually) - includes advanced features, priority support, and 500 users.
3. **Enterprise:** custom pricing for large enterprises with 1,000+ users, including dedicated support, advanced security, and tailored onboarding.

The key differences between these plans are the level of support, scalability, and feature set. The Basic plan is suitable for small businesses or startups, while the Premium plan is geared towards growing businesses that require more advanced features and support. The Enterprise plan is designed for large organizations with complex requirements.

**Target Market Pain Points:**
Our target market is facing challenges in managing customer relationships, sales processes, and data analytics. They struggle with:

1. Disconnected customer data across multiple platforms.
2. Inefficient sales processes, leading to missed opportunities and lost revenue.
3. Limited visibility into customer behavior and preferences.

Our SaaS product addresses these pain points by providing a unified customer view, automating sales workflows, and offering real-time analytics and insights.

**Cost Structure:**
Our main costs include:

1. Infrastructure: cloud hosting, maintenance, and security (30% of revenue).
2. Support: customer support, success management, and training (20% of revenue).
3. Development: product development, engineering, and research (30% of revenue).
4. Marketing and Sales: lead generation, advertising, and sales teams (20% of revenue).

**Regulatory Considerations:**
We need to comply with data protection regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA, as well as industry-specific standards, like HIPAA for healthcare customers.

**Additional Insights:**
We've noticed that our customers are willing to pay a premium for advanced features, priority support, and tailored onboarding. They also value flexibility in pricing plans, with some preferring monthly billing and others opting for annual contracts.

I'm excited to see the results of your market research, competitor analysis, and pricing strategy development. Please let me know if you have any further questions or need additional information to inform your work.
